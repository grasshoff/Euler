He adopts Newton's law of resistance (which says that the pressure exerted by a fluid acting against a plane surface is proportional to the square of the speed, neglecting back pressure) by interpreting it as a statement about differential elements of surface. He calls this assumption \"the common hypothesis\" and uses it to calculate the total resistance, via integration.
