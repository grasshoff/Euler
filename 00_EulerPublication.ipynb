       "1    Euler wrote this Habilitation thesis as part of his application to the Physics chair of the University of Basel in 1727 (it was customary to present a paper of one's research, to demonstrate that one might be of service to the institution). It was reprinted in 1751 in a collection of papers edited by Albrecht von Haller in GÃ¶ttingen.   \n",

He adopts Newton's law of resistance (which says that the pressure exerted by a fluid acting against a plane surface is proportional to the square of the speed, neglecting back pressure) by interpreting it as a statement about differential elements of surface. He calls this assumption \"the common hypothesis\" and uses it to calculate the total resistance, via integration. In this way, he arrives at definite answers (often in elegant, explicit forms) that ...   \n",
